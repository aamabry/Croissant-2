        A croissant is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape. It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspiried by the shape of the Austrian kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thing sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a layered, delicious, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
